/* 
   keyframes is the tool that enables
   us to do a transition from one state to another
   the "animation-*" properties in the css rules
   below control various aspects of the transition
   (such as when it will begin, and how long it will
   take). By using keyframes, you can reuse the same
   transition repeatedly, tweaking the animation
   rules to suit your needs.
